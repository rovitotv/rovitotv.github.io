Summary: Air to ground data link that was capable of 250 Mbits/sec

This was a fun project! We created a wireless air to ground data link that was
capable of 250 Mbits/sec. The same algorithm and math can be used for pointing
sensors.

Abstract: Current persistent surveillance approaches require robust designs to
maintain a fixed operational picture. In this paper, we design, develop, and
demonstrate a feasible aimpoint solution. In the design, we derive the
mathematical transformation requirements to show a system-level design. Using
the transformations, we develop an operational methodology for real-time and
robust aimpoint solution that includes a ground antenna, and an aircraft with a
gimbal mounted camera and data link. Finally, we demonstrate a workable
prototype with real-world results. The AIMS methodology supports communication
timing constraints, a closed-loop feedback for error correction, and a succinct,
efficient, and effective method for maintaining persistent surveillance.

Publicly released source code designed for 32 bit Linux RHEL 5. The code is
simple and should be easily adaptable to any operating system and hardware.
