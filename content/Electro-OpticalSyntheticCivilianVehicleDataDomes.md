Abstractâ€”This paper will look at using open source tools (Blender, LuxRender,
and Python) to generate a large data set to be used to train an object
recognition system. The model produces camera position, camera attitude, and
synthetic camera data that can be used for exploitation purposes. We focus on
electro-optical (EO) visible sensors to simplify the rendering but this work
could be extended to use other rendering tools that support different
modalities. The key idea of this paper is to provide an architecture to produce
synthetic training data which is modular in design and constructed on open-
source off-the-shelf software yielding a physics accurate virtual model of the
object we want to recognize. For this paper the objects we are focused on are
civilian vehicles. This architecture shows how leveraging existing open-source
software allows for practical training of Electro-Optical object recognition
algorithms.
