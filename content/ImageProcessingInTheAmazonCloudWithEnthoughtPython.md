Abstract: Key idea of this work is to provide a open source frame work for
image processing that can be run on different parallel processing platforms.
Parallel processing is necessary because sensors are producing more data at
faster rates. This presentation looks at wide area motion imagery (WAMI) data
from LAIR public released data set. Traditional S&E tools donâ€™t scale in the
cloud in terms of performance or cost. Open source software along with cloud
computing becomes an enabler of affordable parallel processing because license
costs per node are minimized plus computation has become a commodity. This
presentation uses Enthought Python Distribution with parallel processing support
via built-in ZeroMQ. This process can be automated to produce large amounts of
data with minimal human effort.
