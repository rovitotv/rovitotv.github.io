Summary: Using open source tools is an example of layered sensing applications

Abstract: We present an architecture for layered sensing which is constructed
on open source and government off-the-shelf software. This architecture shows
how leveraging existing open-source software allows for practical graphical user
interfaces along with the underlying database and messaging architecture to be
rapidly assimilated and utilized in real-world applications. As an example of
how this works, we present a system composed of a database and a graphical user
interface which can display wide area motion imagery, ground-based sensor data
and overlays from narrow field of view sensors in one composite image composed
of sensor data and other metadata in separate layers on the display. We further
show how the development time is greatly reduced by utilizing open-source
software and integrating it into the final system design. The paper describes
the architecture, the pros and cons of the open-source approach with results for
a layered sensing application with data from multiple disparate sensors.

Pursuer is based on NASA's World Wind and is a good example of Open Source
within the government. We are currently hosting the project on forge.mil with an
active open source DoD community. Links to paper, presentation, and code:
