Summary: Pack 19 Fishing at Camp Hook fun summer time activity

Pack 19 and other packs from Hopewell District had a beautiful day for fishing
and other fun in the sun.  This is our Fishing Challenge: North Hopewell Cub
Scout Kick-Off to Summer event.  The fish were very "smart" with water clear
enough that allowed the boys to watch the fish.  In the picture below this is
Elijah wondering why the fish aren't biting even though he has dropped the worm
right in front of them.  Ironically in one case a fish did bite the worm and
took the half with out the hook.  Another fish took the worm and the hook but
the hook came off the line and the fish got away.  It was catch and release
anyway.  The boys had a great time.
