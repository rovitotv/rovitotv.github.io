Summary: Learn how to build a layered sensing model with open source software version 2

The main focus of this project was to provide an architecture for layered
sensing simulation. It is modular in design and constructed on open-source-off-
the-shelf-software (Blender, LuxRender, Python, OpenCV, and SUMO).

The project was complied from previous work, fixing many errors such as,
multiple vehicle models and color projections. I teamed with and mentored two
undergraduate students throughout the process. Their effort enabled them to
increase their knowledge and experience with Linux, Python, Ray Tracing, and Geo-
Projections.
