:summary: Experimenting with the Raspberry PI Touch Screen running Chromium

For my birthday my lovely Wife got me a Raspberry Pi Touch Screen that is
made by the
`Raspberry Pi foundation <https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/the-eagerly-awaited-raspberry-pi-display/>`_.
This is a 7" display at 800x480 resolution with 10 point capacitive touchscreen.
The screen is easy to install with no soldering required.  You can see first
hand how easy it is to install with this youtube video:

After setting up the screen I then installed the Chromium web browser with
the instructions from this `forum post <https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=121195>`_.
If you read the entire blog post you will discover the author "kusti8" actually
compiled Chromium from source code and posted the packages on dropbox.  I
used the commands in the first post and everything worked great.  For those that
are curious about performance I captured the Raspberry Pi 2 operating with
Chromium in a youtube video and posted here:

When I get my hands on a Raspberry Pi 3 I will update the video to show off
the Raspberry Pi 3's improved performance.
