Summary: Rovitotv and Elijah Meet Marvin Lewis

Being from Cincinnati I am a huge Cincinnati Bengals fan.  No matter how the
team performs I am cheering for them usually watching all the games.  Tonight I
got to meet Coach Marvin Lewis because Elijah has been working hard in school
and got on the honor roll.  Coach Lewis runs the [Marvin Lewis Learning is Cool
program](http://www.marvinlewis.org/LearningisCool.aspx) so we got free tickets
to the Zoo and coupons with Gold Star.  While we were at the Zoo we stood in
line and got to meet Coach Lewis and get this great picture:

Thanks Coach Lewis!!!! It is incredible that you sponsor such a cool event and encourage
kids to do well in school.
