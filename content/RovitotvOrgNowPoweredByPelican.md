Summary: Big changes at rovitotv.org which is now powered by Pelican

Over the holiday break I switched the blog from WordPress on the Raspberry PI
2 to using Pelican.  Pelican is written in Python and is a static web
generator, this means it takes static text files and automatically converts
those pages to HTML.  Static generators are making a come back because of
all the security vulnerabilities in software such as WordPress and having to
maintain a database sever.  If you take a look at my blog I don't even post
more than once a month so I really don't need a complicated dynamic website.
Enjoy the new site and drop me an email to let me know what you think
