Summary: Object recognition with a semi-synthetic model database

Abstract: Object recognition is an important problem that has many applications
that are of interest to the United States Air Force (USAF). Recently the USAF
released its update to Technology Horizons, a report that is designed to guide
the science and technology direction of the Air Force. Technology Horizons
specifically calls out for the need to use autonomous systems in essentially all
aspects of Air Force operations [1]. Object recognition is a key enabler to
autonomous exploitation of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR)
data which might make the automatic searching of millions of hours of video
practical. In particular this paper focuses on vehicle recognition with Loweâ€™s
Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) using a model database that was
generated with semi-synthetic data. To create the model database we used a
desktop laser scanner to create a high resolution 3D facet model. Then the 3D
facet model was imported into LuxRender, a physics accurate ray tracing tool,
and several views were rendered to create a model database. SIFT was selected
because the algorithm is invariant to scale, noise, and illumination making it
possible to create a model database of only a hundred original viewing locations
which keeps the size of the model database reasonable.

After a few years of other work this is my re-entry back into pattern
recognition.
