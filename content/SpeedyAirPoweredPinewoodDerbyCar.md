Summary: How to make a RC air powered pinewood derby car

For the last two years my Son has been involved in Cub Scouts and Pack 19 in
Middletown Ohio puts on a heck of a Pinewood Derby. Pack 19 allows leaders and
parents to build their own cars with the hope that it will distract the parents
and let the Cub Scouts build their own car. This policy works!!!!! I am one of
those Dad’s that obsesses over the Pinewood Derby race. For the 2012 race which
was my Son’s first year I generated a good idea to create an air powered car
that was to use a rubber band but I didn’t have time to complete it. The 2013
Derby was the debut year of the Speedy Air Powered Pinewood Derby Car!!!! Design
changes were made after speaking with a few engineers at AFRL over lunch. The
use of radio controlled (RC) parts made this project possible and fairly easy to
construct.

In the picture above you can see the car being constructed. We used the
following parts:

* Two blocks of pinewood from the standard kit. One block was the car body and the other block was used to build an motor mount
* R/C Speed Controller
* R/C Receiver
* R/C Motor
* Not shown in the picture above battery
* Spektrum DX6i transmitter
* 3 inch 2/3 propeller (buy a bunch of these because a few of these will be broken during testing and construction)

After construction and a few test runs and tweaking the car is shown in the
picture below in its transportation box:

Yes I used rubber bands to hold the car together. This is a bad idea especially
for our track which doesn’t have the best stop mechanism. A few times during the
race I had to realign the parts and apply the rubber bands again. Below is a
picture of all the cars before the start of the race, the Speedy Air Powered
Pinewood Derby car is in the front right of the picture. I was really worried
about the bunny car because it looked fast.

Not shown on the table above another powered car made a appearance at the race
(below) but this Dad had solder problems so we didn’t get to race until the end.
Please take note I am not the only parent obsessed with the Pinewood Derby.

Below are some bad movies. It was difficult to control the throttle and take
movies on my iPhone at the same time. Needless to say this car was very fast. I
rarely had to apply much throttle to win. The car weighed in at exactly 5 oz and
was the exact size and dimensions as required. It was fun to build and even more
fun to race. Thanks to all the people that pitched in I couldn’t of done it
without your help and encouragement!
