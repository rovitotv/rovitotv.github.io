Summary: Major updates at rovitotv.org, switching to github pages

I have been running rovitotv.org blog on a Rapberry Pi for
a while and it has been working with no problems.  But I wanted
to try out github pages and thought moving the site over would
allow me to learn.  So over the weekend I moved the site over
and everything converted without a hitch.  The site is still
powered by Pelican static blog software.  As an additional
side effect I should see improved uptime.  The images, pdf files,
and zip files are hosted from my Google Drive.  My Google Drive
is upgrade to 100 GB because I purchased a Chromebook what a deal.
I plan on blogging about my Chromebook in the near future.

In some ways I will miss my Raspberry Pi but GitHub pages is
free, I like the GitHub workflow, it increased my GitHub
contribution count, and it is carefree.  The only problem
I ran into was how to work with large images, pdf files,
and zip files with git.  When the repository grew a few
mega bytes in size github.com would time out when pushing
changes.  I got around this by hosting the images, pdf files,
and zip files on Google Drive.  Now the website contains
nothing but text.  Another option is to use git-lfs but
using Google Drive didn't require additional software to be
installed. I recommend checking out github pages + Google
Drive + Pelican for your website.
