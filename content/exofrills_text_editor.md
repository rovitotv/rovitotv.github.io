Summary: Using exofrills text editor created with Python

My favorite programming language has been Python for a long time.
Nothing better than using a text editor written with your favorite
programming language, which is what exofrills (aka xo) is.
(As the web site states)[http://exofrills.org] "exofrills - when
nano is too much".  "xo" is the command line name of exofrills
and it is almost as short as the 13 keys used in the text editor.
I am most often in the shell so a editor that works in the shell
with ssh is critical for me and that is what "xo" does, no x11
forwarding or sshfs.  All I need is xo!!!  xo is a little over
1,000 lines of code and uses the urwid Python module for terminal
support.
