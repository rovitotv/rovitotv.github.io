This site is where Todd V. Rovito posts resources from classes Iâ€™ve taught at
Wright State University, as well as my publicly released research papers, and
various posts that cover my interests.  I work at the US Air Force Research Lab
as a Computer Scientist in the Sensors Directorate.

My passion is open source software which I use a lot of at work and home.  My
Son Elijah Rovito and I are involved in Boy Scouts with Troop 18 in Middletown,
Ohio.  I am sure pictures and posts will show up on this site based on our
Boy Scout adventures. Currently we reside in Springboro, Ohio.
